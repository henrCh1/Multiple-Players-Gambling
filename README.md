本程序使用Python编写，利用蒙特卡罗模拟来估计多人多次赌博游戏的期望值。该程序提供了两种投注方式：单倍下注法和双倍下注法，并且可以更改参数，如投注数、赌博次数、初始资金等，以便于您查看不同场景下的赌博模型结果。代码中有详细注释，以帮助您更好地理解其内容。

This program is written in Python and uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the expected value for multiple players in multiple rounds of gambling. The program offers two betting methods: single bet and double bet, and allows for parameters such as bet amount, number of rounds, and initial capital to be modified in order to view the results of the gambling model under different scenarios. The code is extensively commented to help you better understand its content.
